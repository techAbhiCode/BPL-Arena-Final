Traditional learning is fragmented. Students often jump between YouTube for tutorials, LeetCode for practice, and Notion for notes. This leads to "Context-Switching Fatigue" and loss of focus.
BPL Arena solves this by:
Centralizing Resources: An Integrated Learning Environment (ILE) where Video, Code Editor, and Notes coexist on one screen.
Gamifying Education: Introducing a reward system with XP (Experience Points) and visual celebrations (Confetti) to make core subjects like OS and DBMS addictive.
Eliminating Cognitive Overload: Implementing "Domain-Specific Filters" that clear the clutter and show only what the user is currently focused on.

✨ Key Features
🛡️ Domain-Specific Dashboards: Smart routing and filtering for DSA, Operating Systems, DBMS, System Design, and more.
💻 Interactive Coding Arena: A live JavaScript execution environment with real-time feedback and success celebrations.
🧪 Theory Labs: Structured modules for non-coding subjects with conceptual deep-dives and knowledge checks.
🧠 Global AI Assistant: A context-aware AI helper to resolve doubts instantly without leaving the platform.
📝 Persistent Global Notes: A universal note-taking system that stays with the user across all learning modules.
